# Crystal Rooms

Meet in virtual crystal rooms for 6, 36 or 216 people. These crystal rooms have no boundaries, they operate on the crystal grid and allow anyone to be part. The crystal rooms keep track of your notes, conversations and agenda. In a next version, you can even be in such a room completely submersed using virtual reality technology. If you miss an important event in the crystal room you can catch up later and follow what happened. Crystal Rooms are also ideal for education. A Crystal Room can have a Crystal Wall and Crystal Books.
