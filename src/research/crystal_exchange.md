# Circle Exchange.

Today most business models on the internet are based on lockin of people and markets. The more they succeed in getting market dominance the less we have the freedom to make our choices. Their value add = "lock in".

What if there would be a system which allows you to exchange everything for anything. Service for money. Money for other types of money. Product for Time...
Anything can be exchanged.

Our Crystal Exchange allows your Crystal Twin to do this.

## How does it work?

Create a Crystal Page in one of your Crystal Books and announce the availability on a peer2peer Crystal Market of choice.

Anyone can run Crystal Market in the world, just ask you Crystal Twin to announce one. Each Market gets registered in the Crystal Phonebook which is accessible everywhere in the world. A Market can be moderated or not, when moderated the owner of the Market can ask a certain mini percentage on all trades happening in that market. The more added value provided by the Market Owner the more people will accept to pay something for it. A Moderated Market can never aks more than 1% of the goods sold on that market, but typically 0.1% should be a good commission for the market.

Your Crystal Mirror Score (Reputation) is imporant in giving credibility to what you announce on a Market, by delivering good service and or products your rating will go up which will be good for your future services.

Any digital currency can be used to make the trade as long as the currency is supported by the Crystal Wallet.

There are no complicated e-commerce systems needed, just write a page, tag it in the right way, announce it to a marketplace and say how much your product/service costs and which currencies you wish to accept.

Your page can describe house, holiday destination, food, service or even another currency. It can be a fundraise for a good project.

The page is stored/hosted on your Crystal Twin, only the availability will be announced in one or more Markets of choice.

The markets do not decide who can sell what to who. The Markets will match and inform the relevant parties (Crytal Twins).

The Crystal Twins will then amongst each other verify the match and if agreement achieved do the exchange. The 'exchange' does not have to be in 1 step. Multi steps are supported by means of escrow agent(s).


## Escrow Agents.

These are parties which job it is to receive a payment and the good and only when both are there will let the exchange happen.

Eventually there need to be many escrow agents, they have 3 main functions.

- safety: make sure the good is delivered and money is there.
- aggregation: all goods get collected from mutliple spots and as efficient as possible delivered by local delivery agents, not like today where 5 packages are separately delivered for 1 order on Amazon.
- eco: all packaging get's taken back from destination & recycle happens

The flow

- deal agreed
- optional: escrow agent chosen
- escrow agents receives the funds
- the supplier delivers the good/service
- escrow agents receives the good or gets approval from customer service delivered
- escrow agent sends the good to destination or pickup can happen

Escrow agent also have their Crystal Mirror Score.
If unreliable they are removed from the system.

## Money Exchange

Money exchange does not need escrow agents, one agreement achieved between the Crystal Twins an atomic swap is used to do the exchange in such a way it is an all or nothing transaction, no middle party required.
