# Crystal Mirror

The reputation system for our crystal Universe, super important to establish trust between parties for e.g. Crystal Exchange.

## Crystal Identity

Is related to the Crystal Mirror.
A peer review identity verification systems makes sure that your are who you claim you are.

## Identity Score

You get a Identity Score, which means how many people did you get to verify your extended profile.

The following questions are asked by the verifiers (your friends):

- did you verify email, tel, address
- did you verify profile work over last 2 years 
- did you verify profile private life over last 2 years
- did you verify pictures (at least 5 from family and person)

On each give a score 1-10 how much confidence you have in the data.

Every verifier needs to do this carefully because this also defines his/her verifier score.

The Identity score is aggregated out of above information and a number between 1 to 10 per check.

The format is $nrpeopleverified:$avgscore

- e.g. ```10:3``` this would mean 10 people verified but confidence is super lower, basically not verified
- e.g. ```10:9``` this would mean 10 people verified with good confidence.

## Verification Score

Everyone starts with a verification score of 10. If verified users are disputed by others this will reflect on your verification score if you were the one doing the verification, this will make you less trustworthy as a verifier.

## Supplier Score

Applies on products, creations, service, ...

Each offered service/product is tagged see: [crystal exchange technical details](crystal_exchange_technical_details.md), people can score your product/service in relation to the defined tags.

- e.g. for create:design.web score is 10 (is between 1-10)

This allows to build up reputation for your supplied product/service/...
