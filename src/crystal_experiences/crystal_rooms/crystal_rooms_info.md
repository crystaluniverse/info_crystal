# Crystal Rooms

Meet in virtual crystal rooms that can hold up-to 6, 36 or 216 people. These crystal rooms have no boundaries, they operate on the crystal grid and allow anyone to join. The crystal rooms keep track of your notes, conversations and agenda, and share it only with you. If you miss an important event in a crystal room, you can catch up later and follow-up. Crystal Rooms are also ideal for education. A Crystal Room can have a Crystal Wall and Crystal Books attached to it.

In a next version, you will even be able to enter virtual reality rooms with a complete immersive experience.
