# Crystal Books

Our sacred knowledge needs to become the basis of our operating system. This information has to be brought responsibly - no fake news! no market making driven information! A Crystal Book can be a video, audio, and/or text which allows every teacher to be a student or the other way around. Crystal Books give everyone the ability to express their knowledge.

For information to enter Crystal Books they have to respect certain fundamentals:
- author needs to be identifiable
- proof of information shared 
- reviewed by other digital twins

Crystal books seamlessly integrate with the Crystal Mirror and Rooms.
