# Crystal Mirror

A crystal mirror can be described as a reputation system. Once in a while it doesnâ€™t hurt to look at ourselves in a mirror to see how we are doing. Our Crystal Circles can help us with feedback to grow in our path to Crystal Heaven. The purpose of Crystal Mirror is to bring transparency and growth in our digital lives, to empower individuals to learn and to become better human beings. 

Life is all about learning and growth. Crystal Mirror aims to enable you to see yourself crystal clear and to provide you with all the feedback you need to become the person you want to be.
