TODO: Sacha to re-do pictures for wiki with Zia - can check current whitepaper doc here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QjXbaBTUGs4Vpqbe6jcVek9vBJTWbK_SHlkrVhBSKn4/edit# - we will replace all those images and bring it in. 

### Introduction
TF Tech is a software company that has developed technology capable of running any IT workload 100% autonomously. 
For the last couple of years, blockchain was synonymous with decentralization. We believe this is not true – most blockchains are not decentralized at all. They are distributed systems, but not decentralized.
Real decentralization is still centralized but in a different way. In our way of decentralization, we believe that you and your organizations need to become the center of your digital life.

We believe every human or legal entity should have a digital avatar, our digital self. This avatar is an application running in a well-protected environment, is online all the time, and can speak to any other digital avatar in all freedom, and with all efficiency. Much like how cells work in our body, all together we create a functioning digital world, by collaboration.

### Decentralized = Different centralized
Decentralized has the word centralized inside, but in a different way. The idea is not to make an organization or group of people the owner of a centralized system but rather the other way around – you or any legal identity becomes the center of your own digital life.

Each human person or other legal entity (can be a trust, a company, or a government department) owns one crystal twin. This is the main crystal twin you interact with, and this crystal twin can own other crystal twins.

Crystal twins are the actors inside such a system. All data is owned only by crystal twins who are owned by the aforementioned human or legal entities. All crystal twins need to be registered in a digital phone book (implemented by means of blockchain technology).

Each entity (human or legal) can define multiple circles. These circles define how we interact with other crystal twins (access rights, search, etc). 

### The circular smart IT system = “crystal twin” powered
Our IT system is usable for companies, governments, citizens, schools, and so on. The system has the right balance between resilience and efficiency. A lot of services are already available today. 

Crystal Circles - define your interest groups

Circles are the groups you define, with whom you share your information. There is 0% centralization in this system. Blockchains are used where a shared state is required.

### Crystal Twin = Digital Avatar = Digital Self
Your Crystal Twin has been designed to be as efficient as possible. The current memory footprint is less than 200MB yet still it is a wiki system, database, blockchain, web server, indexing & search machine, e-commerce system, wallet, decentralized exchange, and more. It can manage millions of objects and is the center of your company or your digital life.

To create this crystal twin we had no choice other than to start from scratch and re-invent a lot because existing IT components are too centralized and often too inefficient (e.g. memory hungry).

Crystal Twins are intelligent virtual (no humans involved) system administrators which guarantee the uptime, security and performance of it’s users.

### The purpose of the Crystal Twins
- Self-Healing: crystal twins are smart enough to deal with all kinds of expected issues like broken hardware, sites being disconnected from the internet, resource overload situations (e.g. overload of CPU or hard disks almost full), and will re-balance the workloads without causing downtime.
- Life-cycle Management: Each application running on the crystal grid (Threefold Grid) can be managed through it’s full life-cycle by the crystal twin.
- Auto-scaling: The platform automatically scales to meet application and infrastructure performance requirements.

Today our Crystal Twin technology can cover the large majority of issues, although some manual interventions are currently still required. By mid 2020 the aim is to be 100% self-healing and thus zero people will be required to manage the Crystal Grid.
This technology is available today and can be found on our open-source repositories on github. Jumpscale is a framework we have been working on for more than 10 years.

### The Crystal Grid
The global Crystal Grid (ThreeFold Grid) is composed of thousands (eventually millions) of nodes (called Zero Nodes) distributed geographically around the world and running ThreeFold’s operating system called Zero OS.

The Zero OS is supported by INTEL based Hardware Platforms today. To manage this complexity a stateless operating system is a must; such a system avoids upgrades, has no local filesystem or many of the other complex layers you would find in standard operating systems like linux. Zero OS has no human user interface components like UI or Shell Console, only API’s which are used by the crystal twin.

#### Benefits:
- Performance: Lightweight Operating System (“OS”) without overhead for running bare-metal machines. This means there are no complex install procedures required, just a thin efficient software layer on top of hardware.
- Private:“No data left behind” when workloads move from one node to another.
- Distributed: Capacity is generated without the need for data centers at The Edge (which means as close as possible to where end users uses the Internet capacity)
- Highly-available: Any of the Zero Nodes running the Zero OS can go down without impact of the applications running on top of the TF Grid.
- Portability: Moving applications and data from one node to another within the Grid is easy.
- Secure: Much less layers & open-source software deliver better security.
- Green: Advanced algorithms within Zero OS optimize hardware performance and efficiency which results in minimal node power consumption (up-to 10x benefit).
- Integrated storage system: Block & Object based storage systems which self-heal, auto-scale - fast enough for any scale out workload.

This technology is available today and can be found on our open-source repositories on github.

### The Crystal Blockchain
The Crystal Chain (Zero Chain) is a set of blockchain technologies which are currently used inside the TF Grid and invisible for the user today. 

#### Purpose of The Zero Chain:
- Secures the communication between users of the TF Grid and the crystal twin.
- Not based on proof of work - makes it green.
- Scalable new algorithms for distributed databases as well as smart contracts.
- Can work on ‘record level’ which leads to faster transaction times and more a clearer structure which in turn leads to more simplicity & security.
- Secure Execution Environments will allow developers to develop blockchain workloads which can be written in multiple programming languages.
- All these technologies are open-source and can be found on github.

### The Crystal Universe Architecture 
The Crystal Universe architecture consists of Crystal Twins that live on top of the Crystal Grid of capacity and as such there is unlimited scalability.

#### 3 Simple Layers
The system consists of multiple layers, a technical user can create their solutions on any of those layers without needing to know about the other layer e.g. an application developer does not have to know about the capacity layer, but a low level IT expert can deploy his applications directly on the capacity layer.

### Communication Flows
Information flow documented where a user retrieves a video from his/her phone.
Each piece of information gets addressed with only 2 numbers, which makes it very scalable.
All crystal twins are registered on a blockchain (like a phonebook) which makes it secure and efficient.
Data is dispersed over the grid onto multiple nodes providing ultimate security.

### User Advantages 
- More Performance
-Decentralized Video/Voice conferencing is faster.
- Access to information is much faster because information is closer to you.
- More Convenience
- Because all the apps are built using the same backend system which is basically you, the convenience will be much higher. E.g. integrated payments, …
- Easier combination of services.
- Lower Cost of Services and Products
- The more efficient system and elimination of certain unneeded middlemen will lead to much lower cost of services or products.
- We believe for certain services the difference can be substantial like up to 50%
- More transparency and information about the source of the service/product
- Thanks to the Crystal Twin technology it is possible to track the origin of the service you use.
- Build in fair & neutral reputation system improves quality
- The built in reputation system makes sure that quality and price are aligned.
- The crystal twin verification mechanisms are fair and neutral
- Access to more (educational) information 
- All information at your fingertips
- Less manipulation 
- The information you get will come guaranteed from sources you trust. Manipulation should be impossible.
- Equal Rights
- No matter where you live, you will be able to communicate & access information.
- Anyone can deliver services or products online and participate in the FreeFlow Economy.
- No need for complex e-commerce or payment systems.

### Marketing upside down
In the current system you think to get a product for free, but actually you are a product which generates more than 1000 USD per year for the current internet companies.

In our system, you pay for the digital resources you use e.g. storage, network and compute capacity. The person or company who wants to sell a service can broadcast their offering through opt-in marketing channels. In our new Internet/IT system, a user gets rewarded for looking around and investigating which products or services to buy. 

You choose which channels are interesting to your current needs and receives money for actually looking at the offerings. E.g. I am looking to rent an apartment in a certain location or I am looking for a web designer or … I will allow publishers to send information to me.

#### Result:
Merchant will pay much less for marketing his products. And the consumer will receive money for shopping which could be more than the cost of running a crystal twin. Basically, this system puts the marketing world upside down and has benefits for consumers and merchants but not for the intermediaries which often don’t have a lot of added value yet still reap most of the benefits.
