# awareness filter

Crystal twin will not be for everyone, and we are ok with that. Today maybe less than 10% of the planet is ready for the crystal twin but this will change rapidly, its a growing part, people do realize something need to change and there is no time to wait.

What is the criteria, how can we recognize likeminded people?

## the path to awareness

We believe the cross over line is rather binary and very simple to define.

We believe there are multiple criteria which are the same, they are good metrics to see if someone is ready to cross over and become a member of the new growing community.

Realize or live the following:

### We are not a victim !

Stop to look at others to fix the situation, go out of the victim role.
A new president (government) or a company is not going to resolve the situation.
The power is with all of us together, it starts with us, all of us.

### planet first

90%+ of people today look at people around them to blame for the current situation once people are able to look at themselves first and see what they can do the line has been crossed, this is a binary choice. 

###  heart above mind

feel, not think...
the heart knows all, the hear feels.
1 min in each meeting says enough, people who don't feel comfortable to show their heart (which starts with they eyes...)

## remarks

### do we need to meet physically

**No**

The heart is a super powerful instrument. It does not know distance nor space.
Everyone is different in how to perceive this heart energy, some will need a photo, or voice or video, distance should not be a limiting factor.

### is everyone capable to become a member of the crystal nation.

???
