*Why do we need a crystal twin?*

The current state of our digital world comes with certain threats to our sovereignty and security. In recent years, we got to understand that user data was owned and stored by centralized companies that make use of this data for profit outcomes. A famous example is the (facebook - cambridge analytica scandal)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook–Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal]. This scandal shead light on how cambridge analytica gathered billions of data points on U.S citizens to stear elections in favour of one actor and party. It is important to understand that if people owned their own data this would not have been possible. 

The mission of crystal twin is to enable a fully peer-to-peer and autonomous digital world where users own their data and experiences. 

We believe our digital world has to respect the following fundamental:

- sustainability
We need to rethink the way we consume and create better solutions to reduce our environmental footprint. We have to act now to save our planet.
- equality
The UN has declared that “online freedom” is a "human right," and one that must be protected.Yet +3.5 billion people don't have access to the Internet. 
- education & awareness
There is not equal access to the right information and education today. Everyone is different, and people's creative and leadership potential is not developed. Poeple are disconnected – unaware of what's happening, and why we need change. Awareness and consciousness are imperative for change to happen.
- privacy & security
A lack of access and suppressive tactics by certain governments affects our online freedom. There's no security and privacy, we're subject to manipulation.
- convenience
Today's digital world is app-centric and not human-centric. Our experience is therefore complicated. Why do we need 50+ apps on our phone?
