A story like Crystal Twin cannot be funded like an avg startup project.

!!!include:structure.md

The funding will be a 2 step rocket launch.


## Phase 1

We fundraise 5-20m EUR over next 12 months.
The project has no minimal funding requirements it starts not matter what it will be rolling investment instrument.

September 1, 2020, The Crystal Company will accept the first funding money, pre-registrations can start as early as July 2020.

Terms:

- Investment is only for accredited investors.
- Investment structured as convertible loan agreement
    - 0.5% interest per month in relation to GOLD or EUR price (to be selected by investor)
    - Conversion mandatory at phase 2 STO
- Each share = 1000 EUR, minimal shares = 50.
- Loan is protected and has priority on all shareholders (in this case 100% shareholding = a not for profit foundation)


## Phase 2: STO

See [sto](sto.md)

The STO will be organized in such a way to allow the investors of phase 1 to sell at a value higher than their investment + interest. The STO will only be tradable on internal P2P market (using the crystal twin wallet, P2P exchange).

A proper prospectus will have to be created to make this STO in line with all regulations in Europe.

Liquidity cannot be guaranteed at that point by The Crystal Company. 

75% majority decision of Phase 1 investors need to be achieved to agree on the terms of the STO.

The STO tokens are only tradable over decentralized crystal exchange, there is a price protection, which means the STO tokens cannot be sold for less than to be defined terms.


## Phase 3: 

After 5 years, the phase 1 investors will be able to sell their remaining STO tokens to The Crystal Company if required liquidity would not be available on decentralized exchange for the STO tokens. Sales price at that point needs to be at least original investment price + interest as defined above.

## Protection

- 100% of shares of The Crystal Company are backing the loan & STO.
- if there would be a capital increase organized then the existing investors would have the ability to convert at the terms of that round with a 20% discount.
- The invested cash money will be kept 20% in EUR, 80% in GOLD with a physical reliable gold supplier in Europe.

## remarks not for profit & founders financial benefit.

The Crystal Company is 100% owned by the ThreeFold not for profit foundation. 

10% of the STO is the benefit of The Crystal Company & ThreeFold team and will be put to to the benefit of the Bonus Token Pool. See ... The Security Tokens owned by the Bonus Token Pool can only be sold 24 months after STO launch.

If e.g. 20m EUR has been raised for The Crystal Company then 2m EUR of the STO tokens is owned by the Bonus Token Pool. These STO tokens can only be sold 24 months later.
