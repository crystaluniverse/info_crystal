# STO

The Crystal Company will organize an STO which will be completed in 24 months. We will rely on our large userbase to fullfill this STO. The aim is to have many thousands of investors to provide stability to the Crystal Company and provide liquidity to the original investors which would want to exit.

There are good examples today who show that STO's are realistic financial instruments for companies.
