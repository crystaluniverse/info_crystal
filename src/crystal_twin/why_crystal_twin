*Why do we need a crystal twin?*

The current state of our digital world comes with certain threats to our sovereignty and security. In recent years, we got to understand that user data was owned and stored by centralized companies that make use of this data for profit outcomes. A famous example is the (facebook - cambridge analytica scandal)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebookâ€“Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal]. This scandal shead light on how cambridge analytica gathered billions of data points on U.S citizens to stear elections in favour of one actor and party. It is important to understand that if people owned their own data this would not have been possible. 

The mission of crystal twin is to enable a fully peer-to-peer and autonomous digital world where users own their data and experiences. The world needs a digital world that empowers humanity 

With a crystal twin, users benefit from a suite of experiences available which respect the following criteria:
- peer-to-peer (no intermediaries)
- autonomous (empower poeple to be independent)
- fully secure and private (users are sole owners and managers of their data - not companies)
- simple to use (less is more)
- equal to all participants (respect human rights + zero pyramid - fully transparant)
- sustainable (respect our planet)
- performant (guaranteed uptime wherever you are at any time of the day)
