## Crystal DNA
    
To never risk the loss of our history, everything needs to be stored in such a way that it can never be lost, corrupted or hijacked. Once information is created by us it will always remain available as long as we or our children want. The Crystal DNA represents a  perfect archive, which is only accessible by us, and is always guaranteed! 

However, no one can have access to the full DNA history of the Crystal Universe. Only a crystal twin that stores, or a crystal twin with which that information is shared, can access the specific piece of information searched into the Crystal DNA.
